# Summary
This was the most frustrating and challenging of the three major projects up until this point, with the other two being Etch-a-Sketch and a calculator. Overall I am very happy to have completeled this project satisfiably, it is a step in the right direction.

## Concepts learnt/difficulties
- Primary focus was the usage of forms to collect user data
- Also reinforced the importance of properly putting elements into container divs to allow for the right positioning/alignment
- CSS styling as always

## Possible areas for improvement
- There is a little white strip at the bottom of the page when viewing in full-sized window, but it disappears when the window is resized to be smaller. I did try my best to fix this, but was unsuccessful. This does not affect the user experience, but it is something to keep in mind in terms of 'next time around'.
- The style.css file is not 'optimized', as there are certainly areas where code is repeated/not organized by section
